# Rule suggestions contract (`pico-suggestion:v1`)

The shared contract between the **category-suggester** (fireflyx, writes suggestions) and **Firefly Pocket** (reads, edits, approves, rejects them). Neither side depends on the other's code — only on this file and on Firefly III's rules API.

Firefly III is the source of truth. Both components are API clients with their own Personal Access Token.

## Rule groups

Groups are looked up **by title**, never by id.

| Group | Pico env | Holds | Active |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Categorization` | `RULE_GROUP_CATEGORIZATION` | Live rules: the guard `Stop: already categorized` at order 1, then one `Category: {category}` rule per category | yes |
| `Suggestions` | `RULE_GROUP_SUGGESTIONS` | Pending suggestions only, written by the suggester | no (backstop) |

Only the suggester writes to `Suggestions`. Rules there without the `pico-suggestion:v1` marker are not supported and Pico hides them.

## Suggestion rule

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | `Suggest: {category} · {company or keyword}` |
| `rule_group_id` | id of the `Suggestions` group |
| `active` | `false` — a suggestion never fires |
| `trigger` | `store-journal` |
| `strict` | `false` (triggers OR together) |
| `stop_processing` | `true` |
| `triggers[]` | one or more of `description_contains`, `destination_account_contains`, `destination_account_is`, `destination_account_id`; each `active: true`, `stop_processing: true` |
| `actions[]` | exactly one: `set_category={category}`, `active: true`. Firefly requires a value, so a low-confidence suggestion carries the model's best guess |
| `description` | `pico-suggestion:v1 ` followed by the metadata JSON on the same line |

The trigger/strict/stop_processing settings match the `Category:` rules, so triggers can be copied across unchanged.

**Reading `description`:** Firefly 6.6.6 returns rule descriptions HTML-escaped (`&quot;`, `&amp;`, `&#039;`), while titles, triggers and actions come back as written. Readers must HTML-unescape the description (PHP `html_entity_decode($d, ENT_QUOTES)`, Python `html.unescape`) before stripping the `pico-suggestion:v1 ` prefix and parsing the JSON. Writers send plain JSON.

### Metadata JSON

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "transactions": [{ "transaction_id": 285, "journal_id": 285 }],
  "category": "Food & Drink",
  "confidence": 0.86,
  "low_confidence": false,
  "basis": "description",
  "company": "Hoodburger — burger restaurant, Ljubljana Rudnik",
  "reason": "Card purchase at a burger chain",
  "model": "claude-haiku-5-5",
  "created": "2026-10-29"
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `v` | Contract version. Readers ignore rules with an unknown major version. |
| `transactions[]` | Every uncategorized transaction this suggestion covers. `transaction_id` = Firefly transaction group id (Pico route `/transactions/{id}`); `journal_id` = the split that gets the category. |
| `category` | Category name the suggester proposes (same as the `set_category` value). |
| `confidence` | 0–1, from the model. |
| `low_confidence` | `true` when `confidence` < `SUGGESTER_MIN_CONFIDENCE` (default 0.6). Then the only trigger is `description_contains` = the full transaction description. |
| `basis` | `description`, `destination` or `both` — what the triggers match on. |
| `company` | Who the model thinks the counterparty is (from web lookup), or `null`. |
| `reason` | One short sentence for the reviewer. |
| `model`, `created` | Provenance. |

### Trigger rules the suggester follows

- `(unknown destination)` is never used as a trigger value.
- Destination is a private person (e.g. `NRC00` instant payments): description triggers only, never a destination trigger.
- Destination is a company or organisation: `destination_account_id` is preferred.
- `description_contains` values are ≥ 4 characters and are substrings of every covered description.

## Lifecycle

| Action (Pico) | Effect in Firefly |
| --- | --- |
| **Approve** `{category, triggers[]}` | Append triggers (deduplicated) to `Category: {category}` in `Categorization`, creating that rule if missing. Backfill by search: over all time, find `has_no_category:true` transactions matching each approved trigger (the same search as the editor's preview) and set the category on exactly those, plus the suggestion's own `transactions`. Delete the suggestion. Never call a rule or rule-group trigger endpoint (see below). |
| **Set category only** `{category}` | Set the category on its `transactions`. Delete the suggestion. No rule is written. |
| **Reject** | Delete the suggestion. Transactions stay uncategorized. |

No tags or other actions are added in v1.

**Why no rule trigger:** in Firefly 6.6.6, `POST /rule-groups/{id}/trigger` and `POST /rules/{id}/trigger` fire rules outside the group context, so the `Stop: already categorized` guard does not stop them and they would overwrite existing categories. The guard only holds for `store-journal` on new transactions. The search-based backfill never touches a categorized transaction.

## Reconcile (suggester, start of every run)

For each suggestion it created earlier that is no longer in `Suggestions`:

- any of its transactions now has a category → **resolved** (approved or set manually);
- otherwise → **rejected**: the suggester stores the normalised keyword, category and journal ids and never suggests them again.
